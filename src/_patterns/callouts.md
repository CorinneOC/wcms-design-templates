<p>The main page header of this guide is an <code>h1</code> element. Any header elements may include links, as depicted in the example.</p>
<p>The secondary header above is an <code>h2</code> element, which may be used for any form of important page-level header. More than one may be used per page. Consider using an <code>h2</code> unless you need a header level of less importance, or as a sub-header to an existing <code>h2</code> element.</p>
<h3>Third-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h3>
<p>The header above is an <code>h3</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h2</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
<h4>Fourth-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h4>
<div class="callout-left narrow">
<h3>Box Headline</h3>
<img src="http://placehold.it/300x180" alt="">
<p>YOUR TEXT GOES HERE</p>
</div>

<p>The header above is an <code>h4</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h3</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
<h5>Fifth-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h5>
<p>The header above is an <code>h5</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h4</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>
<h6>Sixth-Level Header <a href="#">Linked</a></h6>
<p>The header above is an <code>h6</code> element, which may be used for any form of page-level header which falls below the <code>h5</code> header in a document hierarchy.</p>

<h3>Paragraphs</h3>
<div class="callout-left wide">
<h3>Box Headline</h3>
<p>YOUR TEXT GOES HERE</p>
</div>
<p>All paragraphs are wrapped in <code>p</code> tags. Additionally, <code>p</code> elements can be wrapped with a <code>blockquote</code> element <em>if the <code>p</code> element is indeed a quote</em>. Historically, <code>blockquote</code> has been used purely to force indents, but this is now achieved using CSS. Reserve <code>blockquote</code> for quotes.</p>

<h3>Horizontal rule</h3>
<p>The <code>hr</code> element represents a paragraph-level thematic break, e.g. a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a reference book. The following extract from <cite>Pandora&#8217;s Star</cite> by Peter F. Hamilton shows two paragraphs that precede a scene change and the paragraph that follows it:</p>
<div class="example">
<p>Dudley was ninety-two, in his second life, and fast approaching time for another rejuvenation. Despite his body having the physical age of a standard fifty-year-old, the prospect of a long degrading campaign within academia was one he regarded with dread. For a supposedly advanced civilization, the Intersolar Commonwearth could be appallingly backward at times, not to mention cruel.</p>
<p><i>Maybe it won&#8217;t be that bad</i>, he told himself. The lie was comforting enough to get him through the rest of the night&#8217;s shift.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The Carlton AllLander drove Dudley home just after dawn. Like the astronomer, the vehicle was old and worn, but perfectly capable of doing its job. It had a cheap diesel engine, common enough on a semi-frontier world like Gralmond, although its drive array was a thoroughly modern photoneural processor. With its high suspension and deep-tread tyres it could plough along the dirt track to the observatory in all weather and seasons, including the metre-deep snow of Gralmond&#8217;s winters.</p>
